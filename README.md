> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

If you don't know Yeoman go read up on it [here](http://yeoman.io/) or just follow the instructions below, what's the worse that can happen!?


### Installing

Check if you have yeoman installed with `yo --version` if not use this:

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

We will soon be updating this package to use npm private modules but for now install using the following

```bash
npm install -g @stonecircle/generator-express
```

Create the folder that you want to be a project, cd into that folder and run the following: 

```bash
yo stonecircle-express
```
